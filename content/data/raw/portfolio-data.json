		"csTitle":"Interative Quiz and Photobooth",
		"csOverview":"When IKEA turned 75 they wanted to promote their new catalog in a fun way. We developed a web-based 75-question quiz, completed by scanning QR codes scattered throughout 4-rooms. I lead developers in the technical requirements, user experience and creative execution of the AR browser application.<br/><br/>Additionally, our team created an dynamic photobooth that used tangible objects (including the pull-string of an IKEA lamp) as user inputs. Users were able to time travel through fun iconography and ultimately send themselves their images via SMS.",
		"csResponsibilities":"Technology Management; UX; Quality Assurance; On-going maintenance and enhancements; On-site Training and Trouble Shooting",
		"csTechnology":"HTML5, NodeJS, CSS, AR, Firebase Database, OpenFramework, AWS",
		"csChallenges":"Prior to the activations, we coordinated with vendors to secure and install a Wi-Fi network to handle hundreds of simultaneous connections. During the activations, I interacted with, trained and assisted a 20-person team as well as assisted thousands of customers over 9 days in multiple cities.",
		"csResults":"The onsite feedback and excitement we received from the client and the visitors was incredible. We created a fun experience that thousands of people were compelled to visit again and again. We’ve since optimized the quiz and website to be more manageable by a smaller staff. This smaller version has been used to promote multiple store openings across the country.",

		"csOverview":"Watching people interact with your technology is one of my favorite things. In the best case scenario, they flow through your experience and hardly notice the technology at all. Sometimes the payoff even exceed your expectation.<br/><br/>For the IBM Think conference in 2018, we created an admin tool to register users for a private session within a Portrait Studio. We gathered their basic information and stored it along with a digital talent release form and a professional headshot. These assets were then displayed larger than life on a huge digital billboard in the heart of downtown Las Vegas.<br/><br/>We worked closely with talent representing our client and company in a professional yet fun and stress-free environment. This was a true example of the creative and experience leading the technology.",

		"csTechnology":"HTML5, CSS, NodeJS, SoftLayer, CloundantDB",
		"csChallenges":"Keeping this tool as simple as possible proved to be a key to its success. The UX and design were intentially uncomplicated to let the basic functionality shine. Working with the display vendor had a few hiccups, but ulitmately everything fell into place.",
		"csResults":"When the technology is working as expected, everyone has a good time. The experience was simple and lauded by everyone involved. The client was so pleased that we optimized and iterated the features of our code to do it again the following year in San Francisco.",

		"csOverview":"How do you make sure that everybody is doing their part when it comes to cleaning up? Our team presented SC Johnson with a fun IoT product that would gamify cleanup and help to promote the idea of ‘cleaning equality’ by locking out family members who were attempting to clean more than their fair share.<br/>Overseeing the teams charged with the creation of a SmartBottle, we created a NodeJS API to support multiple Arduino based devices, an admin-driven, front-end dashboard to keep score and manage gameplay, and the coordination of 3D printing a custom model which housed the electronic components and functioning bottle.",

		"csTechnology":"HTML5, NodeJS, CSS, IoT, Custom API, Arduino, 3D Printing",
		"csChallenges":"Aside from the finessing the 3D print to correctly house all the electrical components, the biggest challenge stemmed from the activation launching in Argentina. We were required to trouble shoot the technical limitations of working with and supporting a live activation in an underdeveloped country.",
		"csResults":"It is a fun, quirky idea that people have reacted positively to. The success of the initiative has been confirmed by repeat activations in multiple global markets that SC Johnson supports.",

		"csTitle":"New Development Ecosystem",
		"csOverview":"The technology ecosystem that existed prior to our reorganization was antiquated, confusing and very time-consuming from a development, administration and maintenance standpoint. There were multiple properties isolated from each other, where a simple update required an individual change, build and production push to all.<br/><br/>We solved most of these problems by implementing a Wordpress boilerplate and globally accessible style guide to manage styles and feature updates. Every new feature request was available for use by each property on demand and the data was externalized as part of a custom built stage to production user flow.",

		"csTechnology":"HTML5, WordPress, CSS, Pattern Library, Global Stylesheets, .NET",
		"csChallenges":"The biggest challenge was managing and understanding all of the content and properties we needed to reorganize. Once we knew what we were working with, creating a development and management work flow was the biggest hurdle, but was ultimately the most fun.",
		"csResults":"Our new workflow no longer requires any tech time to update content and our global stylesheet new pushes out minor style revisions to all our different properties at the same time. We've also iterated on our framework multiple times and created a more robust boilerplate for current and future instances of our playbooks.",
